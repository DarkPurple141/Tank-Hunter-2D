# Tank-Hunter-2D
A little toy 2D game made to experiment with paper.js. Game is currently available and playable [here](cheap-nation.surge.sh).

### Preface
I made this largely to play around with paper.js, and as a little hobby project during June 2017.
More than happy for people to extend, use it in whatever way they so choose. Gameplay below:
